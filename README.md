# Build a Forum With Laravel

This is a demo project, based on the Laracast tutorial.

Here is a small description from the first video:

> Today, we're starting a new Laravel forum application from scratch, aiming to reach a wide audience by building a forum using Laravel and its ecosystem. Since the last Laracasts forum series was based on Laravel 5.4 and Bootstrap, and now we're on Laravel 10 with Tailwind CSS and Pest for testing, it's a great opportunity to learn modern Laravel development practices.

I followed the video and used Laravel 12 with the Livewire Starter kit
